DOSO

is the the 'Dice of Symbolique Outcome' write up of a roleplaying system.

It is based on the idea that it is easier to count symbols on some dice than summing up succees effects (see variant 1)

OTOH hand, dice with specialsymbols are hard to come by,so here are also some modules containing symbol ideas: __fromBoardgame.doso.txt__ and __fromOthr.doso.txt__

Thre can be outcome ranges for each symbol.
Symbol might CANCEL, help, leverage OTHR symbol.
__rangeMat.doso__
